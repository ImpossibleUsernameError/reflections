When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I'm interested in sharing my work with other people, a remote 
repository is very useful.
The other people can also check my work and tell me what I could make
better or what changes or new features could be useful. They can even
take my work and continue it and then show their progress to me.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be some commits I don't want to have on my local
repository, for example I make changes from a different computer but 
they don't make a lot of sense.


Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

A fork clones a repository from another Github User to my User on 
Github but not on my local computer. I use it when I want to 
continue someone else's work, but want the changes on my User or
I have no permission to change it on his repository. A clone clones
a repository from a specified URL (Github) to a local repository on 
my computer. I use it when I want to get a repository to my computer.
A branch is kind of a split part of my commit history used to
experiment or build a new feature and so on.
