When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I'm interested in sharing my work with other people, a remote 
repository is very useful.
The other people can also check my work and tell me what I could make
better or what changes or new features could be useful. They can even
take my work and continue it and then show their progress to me.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be some commits I don't want to have on my local
repository, for example I make changes from a different computer but 
they don't make a lot of sense.
