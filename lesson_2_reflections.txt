What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?

When I initialize a new repository, git takes an existing directory 
and makes a git repository out of it. There are no commits and 
all the files included in the directory stay in it. I need it, 
because without it I couldn't make any commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area isn't really a directory. It is just a clipboard
where I can add things which I want to commit. It offers a lot of
control on which files I want to have in one commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

With assistance of the staging area I can view the changes between 
the staging area and the most recent commit using git diff --staged. 
Therefore I can make sure that the change is a logical one.
